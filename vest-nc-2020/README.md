Partner data validation for North Carolina, from VEST 2020. 

Our final validation report for this dataset is available [here](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/vest-2020-north-carolina-precinct-boundaries-and-election-results-shapefile/).

We do not have the raw data sources available on this Github due to file constraints, but we are happy to share them if needed.
